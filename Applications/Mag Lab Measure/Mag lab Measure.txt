PRM HANDLING:
on Open FP: from HDW (through PRM?) to FP
on start of action (measurement(s)): from FP to internal PRM field
on Load CFG: from file to FP (through PRM?)
on Save CFG: from FP to file (through PRM?)

COMPOUND MEASUREMENT
-can encapsulate other MSRMTs
-multiple copies of the same class can be active
