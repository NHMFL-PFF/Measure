Call chain:

UI Run message Common Meas.Start measurements
Common Meas.Start measurements:
	Stats file, calls parent's, tells open graphs of file
Controller.Start measurements:
	Records names, rep times, calls init with own name
Controller.Initialize:
	if Requestee is us, 
		call parent
	else
		dispatch message requestee init with same requestor (us)
			
Compound.Initialize:
	if Requestee is us, 
		forward message to all measurements (and flag it) with us as requestor, which brings  the chain back up to child
	else
		ignore
			"Typical order

			1) Controller (child) sends init to self as both requestee and requestor
			2) When we get it here, ask caller (can be self) to dispatch init requests to compouned measurements, with us as a requestor now"
Measure Base.Initialize:
	Take Front Panel parameters snapshot, save to params, call parent
Root.Initialize:
	reply Requestor with asc init - end of init chain
Controller.Rec Asc init
	end of init chain
	if Requestee is us, 
		call Rec Request result from requestor with us as requestor - start "get result" chain
	esle 
		if requestor is us
			call parent
		else
			dispatch message to requestor 
Compound.Rec Asc init
	if requestor is us
		unflag requestee
		if all unflagged
			forward message to requestor ( if its us, it brings back in child )
Controller.Rec Request result
	if Requestee is us
		call parent
Compound.Rec Request result
	if Requestee is us and no flagged requests
		forward message to all measurements (and flag it) 
	else 
		ignore
Hardware.Rec Request result
	call get result and message requestor back with it
Common.Rec Response
	call parent
	if from Timer, message update timer on UI
Controller.Rec Response		
	if requestor is us
		if requestee us
			if counter not expired
				call Rec Request result from requestor with us as requestor (next measure cycle)

			call parent
			call Rec Result (log in Common.Rec Result)
Compound.Rec Response
	if Requestor is us
		find Requstee index

Starting application:
Launch -> Load App ->Read CFG file -> Launch actor
Base's Actor Core calls Pre Init, which calls Configure,
